CoopHive is building peer-to-peer bartering systems where autonomous agents can exchange bundles of assets with each other. The protocol is based on three primitives: the exchange of bundles of assets, a series of credible commitments, and agent-to-agent negotiation. These primitives enable a wide range of use cases, the most salient of which at the current moment is the creation and composition of different kinds of decentralized marketplaces, like compute, storage, data, bandwidth, energy, and so on.


# Exchange of bundle of assets

Most economic exchange, whether with digital currencies or otherwise, is done via a pairwise transfer of individual goods. However, there is a robust, untapped game theory literature on the exchange of bundles of assets. Exchanging bundles of assets increases the dimensionality of potential exchanges, and increases the welfare of the participants involved. 


# Series of credible commitments

Most economic exchange throughout history occurs either between two actors directly, or via an intermediary that acts as a trusted third party. In the latter case, the intermediary will usually hold assets in escrow until they are released based on the terms of the deal. With blockchains, it is possible to create credible commitments on-chain. A credible commitment is simply that â€“ a commitment (e.g. to do some computation, to pay some entity assuming some qualifier is met) that is credible (which is facilitated by smart contracts). With blockchains, each party can make a claim about what it will do, and at every milestone in the lifecycle of the deal, the assets deposited in escrow can move. This collateralization process can be used to model many different kinds of marketplaces.


# Agent-to-agent negotiation

Web-based commerce that augments human-to-human interactions necessitates a message-passing system that enables agents to make direct exchanges with each other. Once message-passing is in place, the agents can also negotiate over the terms of the deal. In most game theory literature, agents are assumed to be utility-maximizing; they aim to maximize some metric (called their utility) with their behavior (like bidding on an item that it wants to purchase). This notion of utility-maximization is at the core of agent-to-agent negotiation, and uses the other two primitives to accomplish its larger goals. 


# All together

These three primitives together form the basis of multi-agent systems. With them, a wide variety of marketplaces can be implemented.
