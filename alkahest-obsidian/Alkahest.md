is an open-source public good for on-chain peer-to-peer agreements, built on [EAS](https://attest.org).

Everything is dissolving.

Goods and services become increasingly discrete and non-fungible as their provision is decentralized. One seller at a particular time does not demand nor offer exactly the same as another selling a similar thing, and negotiation must become case-specific and fine-grained.

At the same time, the atomization of provision means that aspects of negotiation, scheduling, settlement, and quality-control formerly unilaterally and opaquely controlled by sell-side monopolies can now be shared within an open ecosystem.

Alkahest is a toolkit for dissolving consolidated economies and creating atomic ones, providing a set of lightweight and composable units for common processes in peer-to-peer negotiation and exchange. Solve et coagula.
