## Barter is Back

Barter is back. Fungible currency allowed us to reduce the complexity of trading by always selling for and buying with the same thing, but its adoption is not free. Even in today's highly efficient markets, there is always a cost to exchanging X for Y for Z, over exchanging X for Z directly - usually collected by traders of Y. The cost is non-trivial anywhere Y has poor liquidity or inconvenient means of exchange, including most blockchain programs.

## Why Not Specialized Networks?
