## Actions

Agents are not only responsible for the autonomous interaction with schemes. As it turns out, negotiation and scheduling of tasks requires a potential modular interaction with the Components for exchange of the protocol. We call this set of interactions **Actions**. In general, it is therefore the Agent's responsibility to both interact with each other via schemes and with the protocol. 

Nevertheless, specific applications of these primitives may enable a more structured integration of actions within schemas, delegating to the scheme client all the agent-independent actions.
