TODO ABOVE ME

As also discussed in the following section, Agents are not merely responsible for reading the state associated with the given scheme, but also of performing more generic calculations/verifications. These interactions with generic environmental variables, including separate components of the protocol, are potentially responsible for contributing to the state update policy.

## Actions

Agents are not only responsible for the autonomous interaction with schemes. As it turns out, negotiation and scheduling of tasks requires a potential modular interaction with the Components for exchange of the protocol. We call this set of interactions **Actions**. In general, it is therefore the Agent's responsibility to both interact with each other via schemes and with the protocol. 

Nevertheless, specific applications of these primitives may enable a more structured integration of actions within schemes, delegating to the scheme client all the agent-independent actions.
